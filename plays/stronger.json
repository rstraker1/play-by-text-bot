  "description": "Two actresses who know each other from the theatre happen to meet in a Stockholm ladies' café on Christmas Eve. They talk about marriage, desire, and the strange ways two lives can become tangled without either person quite noticing. A short, strange, unforgettable play.",

  "introAnnotation": "Written in 1889 and first performed in Copenhagen the same year, The Stronger was created for Strindberg's own short-lived Scandinavian Experimental Theatre. It runs about fifteen minutes in performance and was originally designed so the demanding speaking role could anchor the evening while a less experienced actress handled the silent one. Which woman is 'the stronger' — the one going home to husband and children, or the one sitting alone in the café? Strindberg refuses to say. The play was partly a response to Ibsen's A Doll's House, asking what female independence actually looks like when you strip away the speeches. This text follows the Charles Wangel translation, published in Ten Minute Plays, ed. Pierre Loving (Brentano's, 1923), now in the public domain.",
