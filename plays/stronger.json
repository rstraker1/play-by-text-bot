  "description": "Two actresses meet in a Stockholm café on Christmas Eve. One talks. The other never speaks. By the end, you're not sure which of them has won.",
  "introAnnotation": "Written in 1889 and first performed in Copenhagen the same year, The Stronger was created for Strindberg's own short-lived Scandinavian Experimental Theatre. It runs about fifteen minutes in performance and was originally designed so the demanding speaking role could anchor the evening while a less experienced actress handled the silent one. Which woman is 'the stronger' — the one going home to husband and children, or the one sitting alone in the café? Strindberg refuses to say. The play was partly a response to Ibsen's A Doll's House, asking what female independence actually looks like when you strip away the speeches.",
