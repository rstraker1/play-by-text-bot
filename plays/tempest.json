      "annotation": "'When the sea is [patient]' — bitter sarcasm. 'Hence!' means go away. 'Roarers' refers to the roaring waves and wind. His point: the sea doesn't care about social rank. A king drowns as easily as a commoner. This was radical, almost revolutionary stuff for an audience in 1611."

      "annotation": "Biting sarcasm at its finest: 'If your political authority can calm the storm, go ahead — we'll stop working and watch.' He's exposing the limits of earthly power against nature. The Boatswain is one of Shakespeare's great minor characters — honest, competent, and unimpressed by rank."

      "annotation": "Gonzalo continues his gallows humor: let Fate make sure this man hangs — because that would mean we survive this storm. 'Our cable' (anchor rope) isn't helping; maybe his destiny to hang will save us. If he's NOT destined to hang, we're doomed."

      "annotation": "The full scene ends with everyone believing they'll drown. But this tempest is an illusion, controlled by Prospero from his island. No one is harmed. The play's title comes from this opening storm, which is both literal and metaphorical — a disruption that will lead to reconciliation and restoration."
