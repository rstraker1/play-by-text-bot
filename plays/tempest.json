  "introAnnotation": "Written around 1610–11, The Tempest is believed to be the last play Shakespeare wrote on his own. It was partly inspired by real accounts of the Sea Venture, an English ship wrecked on Bermuda in 1609 while sailing to the Virginia colony. The play explores power, forgiveness, colonialism, and the nature of art itself — themes that feel remarkably current four centuries later. Unusually for Shakespeare, the plot appears to be entirely original rather than adapted from an existing source.",

      "annotation": "'Heigh, my hearts!' is a rallying cry, like 'Come on, lads!' 'Cheerly' means with spirit. He's encouraging the sailors while ordering them to lower the topsail (a sail near the top of the mast). The master's whistle signals commands."

      "annotation": "'When the sea is [patient]' — bitter sarcasm. 'Hence!' means go away. 'Roarers' refers to the roaring waves and wind. His point: the sea doesn't care about social rank. A king drowns as easily as a commoner. This was radical, almost revolutionary stuff for an audience in 1611."

      "annotation": "Gonzalo continues his gallows humor: let Fate make sure this man hangs — because that would mean we survive this storm. 'Our cable' (anchor rope) isn't helping; maybe his destiny to hang will save us. If he's NOT destined to hang, we're doomed."

      "annotation": "The full scene ends with everyone believing they'll drown. But this tempest is an illusion, controlled by Prospero from his island. No one is harmed. The play's title comes from this opening storm, which is both literal and metaphorical — a disruption that will lead to reconciliation and restoration."
